### What was your role / which stories did you work on
My role was integrator, but there wasn't as many pull requests as we had hoped. I worked on implementing the search by muscle and getting the workout based off of that muscle.
- What was the biggest challenge?
  - My biggest challenge was trying to get expo running 
- Why was it a challenge?
  - The reason it was so challenging was that I would follow the instructions and spend hours trying to run it but would constantly get errors.
- Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  - My favorite part of the project was being able to run the app on my phone as it felt like progress was actually being made.
- If you could do it over, what would you change?
