### What was your role / which stories did you work on
My role was integrator, but there wasn't as many pull requests as we had hoped. I worked on implementing the search by muscle and getting the workout based off of that muscle.
- What was the biggest challenge?
  - My biggest challenge was trying to get expo running 
- Why was it a challenge?
  - The reason it was so challenging was that I would follow the instructions and spend hours trying to run it but would constantly get errors.
- Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  - My favorite part of the project was being able to run the app on my phone as it felt like progress was actually being made.
- If you could do it over, what would you change?
  - Communication and having a schedule planned out more throughly.
- What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  - The most valuable thing that I learned was how to use Github and the terminal as they are vital.

2. Alvaro's github issues are [here](https://github.com/saniyaw7/Project1SE/issues/created_by/Alvaro-DLC)
### What was your role / which stories did you work on
I worked on a searching filter for the api where the user would be able to select an equipment and display the exercises liked to it.
- What was the biggest challenge?
  The biggest challenge would be getting the enviroment of the app to run.
- Why was it a challenge?
  we had all things set up but the enviroment wouldn't work so we had to switch app templates to get it working 
- Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  working with the APi was the most intersting part for me
- If you could do it over, what would you change?
  I would change the initial template for the app that we used and done more reasearch on it to see what was the issue.
- What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  Communication and having your set up correct is important when working on a project.

### Peter Mitchell

1. Peter's pull requests are [here](https://github.com/saniyaw7/Project1SE/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AMitPete+is%3Aclosed).
2. Peter's GitHub issues are [here](https://github.com/saniyaw7/Project1SE/issues/created_by/MitPete).
### What was your role / which stories did you work on?
I worked on various user stories, including:
- Ingredient Search and Ingredient Detail Screen, which allowed users to search for ingredients and view detailed nutritional information.
- Firebase Authentication for login and registration with validation and navigation management.
- Schedule Exercise functionality to enable users to select exercises and schedule them.
- Exercise Appointments feature to manage and view scheduled exercises.
- Comment sections for exercises, allowing users to view, add, and upvote/downvote comments.
- Unit testing for several components like `ScheduleExercise`, `ViewExerciseAppointments`, `LoginScreen`, and `RegisterScreen`, using Jest and mock AsyncStorage.
- Created and implemented components such as the `Logo` component and `ViewExerciseAppointments` for managing exercise appointments.
### What was the biggest challenge?
The biggest challenge was implementing the `ExerciseCommentScreen` component with upvote and downvote functionality and ensuring that both local and global data was consistently synchronized across the app.
### Why was it a challenge?
It was challenging because managing comments across both the local exercise-specific storage and global app storage required careful handling of data consistency, especially when updating votes for specific comments. Ensuring that changes were reflected correctly while using AsyncStorage and React hooks required extra attention to detail.
### Favorite / most interesting part of this project?
The most interesting part of the project was working on the Schedule Exercise feature and integrating AsyncStorage to store the userâ€™s selected exercises and schedule them. I enjoyed seeing how the app could store this data and retrieve it seamlessly, providing a great user experience.
### If you could do it over, what would you change?
If I could do it over, I would focus on setting up more efficient data management early on, possibly by integrating a state management library like Redux for handling the app's state across different components. This could have made syncing data easier and reduced the complexity of managing local storage manually.
### What is the most valuable thing you learned?
The most valuable thing I learned was how to manage persistent storage in React Native using AsyncStorage and how to write effective unit tests for components that rely on data storage. These skills will be incredibly useful for future projects where I need to handle user data across sessions.

### What was your role / which stories did you work on
I tried working on the database but could not complete my assigned task due to unknow errors in Android Studio and Visual Studio Code
- What was the biggest challenge?
  I woukd say the "biggest challenge" I faced till the end was getting Android Studio/Visual Studio Code running/ The environment for the Android Studio.
- Why was it a challenge?
  It threw the randommest error to me because of whch I could get the code running on my laptop still the end to complete my assigned task (database). I did try to research and solve the errors my myslef but it seemed like ni ine was fimilar with the    
  issue. There was a point I was repeating the steps over and over but the results were the same. Also I did attend the office hours and asked help to the professor but non seem to work.
- Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  When the API worked (specificly the Search engine)
- If you could do it over, what would you change?
  Would write the code in java instead of java script.
- What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  DO NOT GIVE UP. keep trying till the very end
