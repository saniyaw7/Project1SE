## Introduction

- How was communication managed
  - We communicated through Slack
- How many stories/issues were initially considered
  - We had originally considered 12 stories, 4 each week
- How many stories/issues were completed
  - We completed _ stories/issues

### What was your role / which stories did you work on
My role was integrator, but there wasn't as many pull requests as we had hoped. I worked on implementing the search by muscle and getting the workout based off of that muscle.
- What was the biggest challenge?
  - My biggest challenge was trying to get expo running 
- Why was it a challenge?
  - The reason it was so challenging was that I would follow the instructions and spend hours trying to run it but would constantly get errors.
- Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  - My favorite part of the project was being able to run the app on my phone as it felt like progress was actually being made.
- If you could do it over, what would you change?
  - Communication and having a schedule planned out more throughly.
- What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  - The most valuable thing that I learned was how to use Github and the terminal as they are vital.

### What was your role / which stories did you work on?
I worked on various user stories, including:
- Ingredient Search and Ingredient Detail Screen, which allowed users to search for ingredients and view detailed nutritional information.
- Firebase Authentication for login and registration with validation and navigation management.
- Schedule Exercise functionality to enable users to select exercises and schedule them.
- Exercise Appointments feature to manage and view scheduled exercises.
- Comment sections for exercises, allowing users to view, add, and upvote/downvote comments.
- Unit testing for several components like `ScheduleExercise`, `ViewExerciseAppointments`, `LoginScreen`, and `RegisterScreen`, using Jest and mock AsyncStorage.
- Created and implemented components such as the `Logo` component and `ViewExerciseAppointments` for managing exercise appointments.
### What was the biggest challenge?
The biggest challenge was implementing the `ExerciseCommentScreen` component with upvote and downvote functionality and ensuring that both local and global data was consistently synchronized across the app.
### Why was it a challenge?
It was challenging because managing comments across both the local exercise-specific storage and global app storage required careful handling of data consistency, especially when updating votes for specific comments. Ensuring that changes were reflected correctly while using AsyncStorage and React hooks required extra attention to detail.
### Favorite / most interesting part of this project?
The most interesting part of the project was working on the Schedule Exercise feature and integrating AsyncStorage to store the userâ€™s selected exercises and schedule them. I enjoyed seeing how the app could store this data and retrieve it seamlessly, providing a great user experience.
### If you could do it over, what would you change?
If I could do it over, I would focus on setting up more efficient data management early on, possibly by integrating a state management library like Redux for handling the app's state across different components. This could have made syncing data easier and reduced the complexity of managing local storage manually.
### What is the most valuable thing you learned?
The most valuable thing I learned was how to manage persistent storage in React Native using AsyncStorage and how to write effective unit tests for components that rely on data storage. These skills will be incredibly useful for future projects where I need to handle user data across sessions.
